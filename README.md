# AES 8576 bits Encryption Cipher
Advanced Encryption Standard with 8576-bit keys.
128-bit block, 66 rounds, 8576-bit keys with 268 * 32-bit subkeys.

AES256 uses 256-bit keys and only 14 rounds.

In 2016 AES-8576 was released, it uses the same principle as the AES256 but with 66 rounds and the 268 subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function.
